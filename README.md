This program allows users to enter dimensions of triangles and then it tells you the type of triangle they have created whether its an isosceles or scalene or equillateral.


## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
Enter the parameters of the triangle in the empty slots provided then click on the Answer button below and it will tell you the type of  triangle you have created.


## PROJECT BREAKDOWN:
This program enables a user to enter numbers in the provided slots. The dimensions to be processed have to be 3 . After analysis the user is notified on what type of triangle has the listed dimensions.
If 3  numbers are identical,they get notified that they've created an Equilateral triangle. If similar numbers are entered the user will be notified that its an Isosceles triangle. If all the dimensions entered are different then its a Scalene triangle and lastly, if two dimensions of the triangle entered is less than or equal to the length of the third side he or she will be informed that they have not created a triangle.
